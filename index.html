              Chandigarh is a city, district and union territory in India that serves as the joint capital of the two neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana. 
              Chandigarh is bordered by the state of Punjab to the north, the west and the south, and by the state of Haryana to the east. It constitutes the bulk of the Chandigarh Capital 
              Region or Greater Chandigarh, which also includes the adjacent satellite cities of Panchkula and Mohali. Chandigarh is one of the earliest planned cities in post-independence 
              India and is internationally known for its architecture and urban design. The master plan of the city was prepared by Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, which built upon 
              earlier plans created by the Polish architect Maciej Nowicki and the American planner Albert Mayer. Most of the government buildings and housing in the city were designed by a 
              team headed by Le Corbusier, Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry. Chandigarh has grown greatly since its initial construction, and has also driven the development of two satellite 
              cities in its neighbouring states. The metropolitan area of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula collectively forms a "tri-city". The city has one of the highest per capita incomes 
              in the country. The union territory has one of the highest Human Development Index among Indian states and territories. In 2015, a survey by LG Electronics ranked it as the 
              happiest city in India on the happiness index. In 2015, an article published by BBC named Chandigarh one of the few master-planned cities in the world to have succeeded in terms 
              of combining monumental architecture, cultural growth, and modernisation.

            <h3>Pay demolition costs at earliest or face action, Chandigarh Housing Board tells violators</h3>
            <p>
              The Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) has decided to adopt a zero tolerance policy towards illegal constructions and encroachment on government/public land and has asked offenders to clear demolition costs to be paid to the board, besides warning them about not undertaking any fresh illegal constructions. “All the allottees who have been issued challans/demolition notices against fresh constructions are required to remove the violations immediately to avoid demolition by the Chandigarh Housing Board. During the last three years, the CHB has demolished un-authorised constructions and recovered the cost of demolitions from the allottees. In case of non-payment, their allotments are liable to be cancelled,” a statement issued by the housing board said. The cost of demolition includes various components on actual basis. In case more than one unit is demolished on a particular day then the cost is apportioned among the units taken-up for demolition. Unit wise detail of cost of demolition levied and status of its payment has been uploaded on the website of the CHB, an official said.

            <p>
              The march, led by party’s Chandigarh president HS Lucky, was stopped by police after the protesters covered some distance from the Sector 18/19 light point while heading towards the Punjab Raj Bhavan. Party members were detained by the police as they tried to break the barricades and were taken to the Sector-19 police station. Speaking on the occasion, Lucky said, “At least one reason for the rising prices is the wasteful government expenditure, including crores spent on the publicity of the prime minister and his cabinet colleagues, and the pro-rich policy of the government to give sops to the rich corporate by squeezing money out of the pockets of the common man.”
